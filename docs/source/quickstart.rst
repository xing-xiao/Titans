QuickStart
============

The following are examples of supported markup.  On their own, these will not provide a datepicker widget; you will need to instantiate the datepicker on the markup.


input
-----

The simplest case: focusing the input (clicking or tabbing into it) will show the picker.

component
---------

Adding the ``date`` class to an ``input-group`` bootstrap component will allow the ``input-group-addon`` elements to trigger the picker.
